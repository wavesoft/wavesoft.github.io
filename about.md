Hello world, I am Ioannis Charalampidis!

Software development is my Passion, my Profession and my Hobby. Yet I am Creative and Artistic, with a major in Architecture Engineering. (Talk about diversity!). I rarely blog, due to lack of time, but when I do, I usually have something interesting to sare with the world!

If you are interested to learn more about me [Visit my LinkedIn Profile](    https://gr.linkedin.com/in/icharalampidis).

This blog is still on it's beta phase. Come back later and more material might be available ;)
